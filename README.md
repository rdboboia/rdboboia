# Intro
- 👋 Hi, I’m @rdboboia.
- 👀 I’m interested in technology, specially in computers.
- 📚 I'm work as a Software Engineer in the mornings, and as a self taught Advanced IT guy in the evenings 😎.
- 🏢 I’m currently working at Babel SI (https://es.linkedin.com/company/babel).
- 🌱 I’m expanding my knowledge in Java, Springboot (for work) and Windows Batch and PowerShell scripting (for my personal projects).
- ☕ I'm investing a lot of time in my github repositories lately, which are all public, so if you feel like it you can "buy me a coffee" from the link in my profile 😜.
