# Short intro
I'm a full time developer (both for work and for personal projects that I usually share with the world here on GitHub).
I also LOVE gaming, but I don't have that much time nor energy for it lately.

# About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @rdboboia.
- 👀 I’m interested in technology, specially in computers.
- 📚 I'm work as an Software Engineer in the mornings, and an self taught Advanced IT guy in the evenings 😎.
- 🏢 I’m currently working at Babel SI (https://es.linkedin.com/company/babel).
- 🌱 I’m expanding my knowledge in Java, Springboot (for work) and Windows Batch and PowerShell scripting (for my personal projects).
